 * fl_table: Pointer to the first level page table.
 * redirect: Set to 1 if L2 redirect for page tables are enabled, 0 otherwise.
 * unaligned_fl_table: Original address of memory for the page table.
 * fl_table is manually aligned (as per spec) but we need the original address
 * to free the table.
 * fl_table_shadow: This is "copy" of the fl_table with some differences.
 * It stores the same information as fl_table except that instead of storing
 * second level page table address + page table entry descriptor bits it
 * stores the second level page table address and the number of used second
 * level page tables entries. This is used to check whether we need to free
 * the second level page table which allows us to also free the second level
 * page table after doing a TLB invalidate which should catch bugs with
 * clients trying to unmap an address that is being used.
 * fl_table_shadow will use the lower 9 bits for the use count and the upper
 * bits for the second level page table address.
 * sl_table_shadow uses the same concept as fl_table_shadow but for LPAE 2nd
 * level page tables.
