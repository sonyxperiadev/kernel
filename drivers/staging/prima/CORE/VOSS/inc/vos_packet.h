  Takes as input an OS provided data packet and 'wraps' that packet in a 
  vos_packet, returning the vos_packet to the caller.  
  
  This function is intended to be called from the HDD to wrap Tx data packets
  from the OS into vos_packets before sending them to TL for transmission.

         When packets become available, the callback callback function is
         invoked to return a VOS packet to the caller.  Note that the

  This API inserts an OS packet into a previously retreived VOS packet.
  This API only applies to VOS packets of type VOS_PKT_TYPE_802_3_DATA or
  VOS_PKT_TYPE_802_11_DATA.  
  
  There are cases where a user will need to get a VOS data packet without 
  having the OS packet to insert/wrap into the data packet. This could happen
  if the user calls vos_pkt_wrap_data_packet() without the OS packet.  
  
  Also, when the user hit a 'low resource' situation for data packets, the 
  low resource callback is going to return a VOS packet without an OS packet
  attached to it.  The caller who gets the packet through the low resource
  callback uses this API to insert an OS packet into the VOS packet that 
  was returned through the low resource callback.
  
  \param pPacket - the voss Packet to insert the OS packet into.
         
  \param pOSPacket - a pointer to the Transmit packet provided by the OS.  This
         OS provided packet will be wrapped into a vos_packet_t.  Note this

         into a VOS packet of type VOS_PKT_TYPE_802_3_DATA or

         VOS packet already, this API will blindly overwrite the OS packet
         with the new one specified on this API call.  If you need to determine
