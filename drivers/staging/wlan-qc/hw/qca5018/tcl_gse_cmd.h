gse_sel
			
			Bit to select the ASE or FSE to do the operation mention
			by GSE_ctrl bit
			
			0: FSE select
			
			1: ASE select

status_destination_ring_id
			
			The TCL status ring to which the GSE status needs to be

			<legal all>

index_search_en
			
			When this bit is set to 1 control_buffer_addr[19:0] will
			be considered as index of the AST or Flow table and GSE
			commands will be executed accordingly on the entry pointed
			by the index. 
			
			This feature is disabled by setting this bit to 0.
			
			<enum 0 index_based_cmd_disable>
			
			<enum 1 index_based_cmd_enable>

cache_set_num
			
			Cache set number that should be used to cache the index
			based search results, for address and flow search. This
			value should be equal to value of cache_set_num for the
			index that is issued in TCL_DATA_CMD during search index
			based ASE or FSE. This field is valid for index based GSE

looping_count
			
			A count value that indicates the number of times the
			producer of entries into the Ring has looped around the
			ring.
			
			At initialization time, this value is set to 0. On the
			first loop, this value is set to 1. After the max value is
			reached allowed by the number of bits for this field, the
			count value continues with 0 again.
			
			
			
			In case SW is the consumer of the ring entries, it can
			use this field to figure out up to where the producer of
			entries has created new entries. This eliminates the need to
			check where the head pointer' of the ring is located once
			the SW starts processing an interrupt indicating that new
			entries have been put into this ring...
			
			
			
			Also note that SW if it wants only needs to look at the
			LSB bit of this count value.
