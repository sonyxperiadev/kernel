			<legal all>

src_swap
			
			Treats source memory organization as big-endian. For

			and byte 1 is swapped with byte 2.
			
			In case of gather field in first source ring entry of

dest_swap
			
			Treats destination memory organization as big-endian.

			byte 3 and byte 1 is swapped with byte 2.
			
			In case of gather field in first source ring entry of

gather
			
			Enables gather of multiple copy engine source
			descriptors to one destination.

ce_res_0
			
			Reserved
			
			<legal all>

length
			
			Length of the buffer in units of octets of the current

ring_id
			
			The buffer pointer ring ID.
			
			0 refers to the IDLE ring
			
			1 - N refers to other rings
			
			
			
			Helps with debugging when dumping ring contents.
			
			<legal all>

looping_count
			
			A count value that indicates the number of times the
			producer of entries into the Ring has looped around the
			ring.
			
			At initialization time, this value is set to 0. On the
			first loop, this value is set to 1. After the max value is
			reached allowed by the number of bits for this field, the
			count value continues with 0 again.
			
			In case SW is the consumer of the ring entries, it can
			use this field to figure out up to where the producer of
			entries has created new entries. This eliminates the need to
			check where the head pointer' of the ring is located once
			the SW starts processing an interrupt indicating that new
			entries have been put into this ring...
			
			Also note that SW if it wants only needs to look at the
			LSB bit of this count value.
