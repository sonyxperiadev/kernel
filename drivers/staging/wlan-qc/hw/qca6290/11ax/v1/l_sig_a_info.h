rate
			
			This format is originally defined for OFDM as a 4 bit
			field but the 5th bit was added to indicate 11b formatted
			frames.  In the standard bit [4] is specified as reserved. 
			For 11b frames this L-SIG is transformed in the PHY into the
			11b preamble format.  The following are the rates:
			
			<enum 8     ofdm_48_mbps> 64-QAM 2/3 (48 Mbps)
			
			<enum 9     ofdm_24_mbps> 16-QAM 1/2 (24 Mbps)
			
			<enum 10     ofdm_12_mbps> QPSK 1/2 (12 Mbps)
			
			<enum 11     ofdm_6_mbps> BPSK 1/2 (6 Mbps)
			
			<enum 12     ofdm_54_mbps> 64-QAM 3/4 (54 Mbps)
			
			<enum 13     ofdm_36_mbps> 16-QAM 3/4 (36 Mbps)
			
			<enum 14     ofdm_18_mbps> QPSK 1/2 (18 Mbps)
			
			<enum 15     ofdm_9_mbps> BPSK 3/4 (9 Mbps)
			
			<legal 8-15>

lsig_reserved
			
			Reserved: Should be set to 0 by the MAC and ignored by
			the PHY
			
			<legal 0>

length
			
			The length indicates the number of octets in this MPDU. 
			Note that when using mixed mode 11n preamble this length
			provides the spoofed length for the PPDU.  This length
			provides part of the information to derive the actually PPDU
			length.  For legacy OFDM and 11B frames the maximum length
			is 
			
			<legal all>

parity
			
			11a/n/ac TX: This field provides even parity over the
			first 18 bits of the signal field which means that the sum
			of 1s in the signal field will always be even on
			
			11a/n/ac RX: this field contains the received parity
			field from the L-SIG symbol for the current packet.
			
			<legal 0-1>

tail
			
			The 6 bits of tail is always set to 0 is used to flush
			the BCC encoder and decoder.  <legal 0>

pkt_type
			
			Only used on the RX side.  
			
			Note: This is not really part of L-SIG
			
			
			
			Packet type:
			
			<enum 0 dot11a>802.11a PPDU type
			
			<enum 1 dot11b>802.11b PPDU type
			
			<enum 2 dot11n_mm>802.11n Mixed Mode PPDU type
			
			<enum 3 dot11ac>802.11ac PPDU type
			
			<enum 4 dot11ax>802.11ax PPDU type

captured_implicit_sounding
			
			Only used on the RX side.  
			
			Note: This is not really part of L-SIG
			
			
			
			This indicates that the PHY has captured implicit
			sounding.

reserved
			
			Reserved: Should be set to 0 by the transmitting MAC and
			ignored by the PHY <legal 0>
