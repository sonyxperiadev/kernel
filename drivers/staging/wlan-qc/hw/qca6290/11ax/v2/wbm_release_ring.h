struct buffer_addr_info released_buff_or_desc_addr_info
			
			Consumer: WBM/SW/FW
			
			Producer: SW/TQM/RXDMA/REO/SWITCH
			
			
			
			Details of the physical address of the buffer or link
			descriptor that is being released. Note that within this
			descriptor, WBM will look at the 'owner' of the released
			buffer/descriptor and forward it to SW/FW is WBM is not the
			owner.

release_source_module
			
			Indicates which module initiated the release of this
			buffer or descriptor
			
			
			
			<enum 0 release_source_TQM> TQM released this buffer or
			descriptor

			An MSDU extension descriptor shall never be marked as
			
			
			
			<enum 0 Put_in_idle_list> Put the buffer or descriptor
			back in the idle list. In case of MSDU or MDPU link
			descriptor, BM does not need to check to release any
			individual MSDU buffers

			which MSDU pointer in the MSDU link descriptor is the first
			of an MPDU that is released.
			
			BM shall release all the MSDU buffers linked to this
			first MSDU buffer pointer. All related MSDU buffer pointer
			entries shall be set to value 0, which represents the 'NULL
			pointer. When all MSDU buffer pointers in the MSDU link
			descriptor are 'NULL', the MSDU link descriptor itself shall
			also be released.
			
			
			
			<enum 2 Put_in_idle_list_expanded> CURRENTLY NOT
			IMPLEMENTED....
			
			Put the buffer or descriptor back in the idle list. Only

			MSDU extension descriptor.
			
			In case BM finds this one in a release ring, it passes
			it on to FW...
			
			<enum 4 queue_ext_descriptor> The address points to an
			TQM queue extension descriptor. WBM should treat this is the
			same way as a link descriptor. That is, put the 128 byte
			buffer back in the link buffer idle list.

			Producer: SW/TQM/RXDMA/REO/SWITCH
			
			
			
			A count value that indicates the number of times the
			producer of entries into the Buffer Manager Ring has looped
			around the ring.
			
			At initialization time, this value is set to 0. On the
			first loop, this value is set to 1. After the max value is
			reached allowed by the number of bits for this field, the
			count value continues with 0 again.
			
			
			
			In case SW is the consumer of the ring entries, it can
			use this field to figure out up to where the producer of
			entries has created new entries. This eliminates the need to
			check where the head pointer' of the ring is located once
			the SW starts processing an interrupt indicating that new
			entries have been put into this ring...
			
			
			
			Also note that SW if it wants only needs to look at the
			LSB bit of this count value.

/* Description		WBM_RELEASE_RING_7_LOOPING_COUNT
			
			Consumer: WBM/SW/FW
			
			Producer: SW/TQM/RXDMA/REO/SWITCH
			
			
			
			A count value that indicates the number of times the
			producer of entries into the Buffer Manager Ring has looped
			around the ring.
			
			At initialization time, this value is set to 0. On the
			first loop, this value is set to 1. After the max value is
			reached allowed by the number of bits for this field, the
			count value continues with 0 again.
			
			
			
			In case SW is the consumer of the ring entries, it can
			use this field to figure out up to where the producer of
			entries has created new entries. This eliminates the need to
			check where the head pointer' of the ring is located once
			the SW starts processing an interrupt indicating that new
			entries have been put into this ring...
			
			
			
			Also note that SW if it wants only needs to look at the
			LSB bit of this count value.
