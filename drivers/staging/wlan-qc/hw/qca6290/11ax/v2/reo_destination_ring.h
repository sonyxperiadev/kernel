			<legal all>

looping_count
			
			A count value that indicates the number of times the

			reached allowed by the number of bits for this field, the
			count value continues with 0 again.
			
			In case SW is the consumer of the ring entries, it can
			use this field to figure out up to where the producer of
			entries has created new entries. This eliminates the need to
			check where the head pointer' of the ring is located once
			the SW starts processing an interrupt indicating that new
			entries have been put into this ring...
			
			
			
			Also note that SW if it wants only needs to look at the
			LSB bit of this count value.

/* Description		REO_DESTINATION_RING_15_LOOPING_COUNT
			
			A count value that indicates the number of times the
			producer of entries into this Ring has looped around the
			ring.
			
			At initialization time, this value is set to 0. On the
			first loop, this value is set to 1. After the max value is
			reached allowed by the number of bits for this field, the
			count value continues with 0 again.
			
			In case SW is the consumer of the ring entries, it can
			use this field to figure out up to where the producer of
			entries has created new entries. This eliminates the need to
			check where the head pointer' of the ring is located once
			the SW starts processing an interrupt indicating that new
			entries have been put into this ring...
			
			
			
			Also note that SW if it wants only needs to look at the
			LSB bit of this count value.
