config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	help
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_VSOC
	tristate "Android Virtual SoC support"
	default n
	depends on PCI_MSI
	help
	  This option adds support for the Virtual SoC driver needed to boot
	  a 'cuttlefish' Android image inside QEmu. The driver interacts with
	  a QEmu ivshmem device. If built as a module, it will be called vsoc.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	select HAVE_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.
	  The registered process will kill according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_TNG
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer TNG"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	select OOM_SCORE_NOTIFIER
	---help---
	  The NEXT generation (TNG) lowmemorykiller.
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.

	  The registered process will kills according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_STATS
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: collect statistics"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_TNG
	default n
	help
	  Create a file in /proc/lmkstats that includes
	  collected statistics about kills, scans and counts
	  and  interaction with the shrinker. Its content
	  will be different depending on lmk implementation used
	  in TNG lowmemorykiller.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_AUTODETECT_OOM_ADJ_VALUES
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: detect oom_adj values"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	default y
	---help---
	  Detect oom_adj values written to
	  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adj and convert them
	  to oom_score_adj values.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_CONSIDER_SWAP
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: consider swap free size"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER && SWAP
	default n
	---help---
	  Use freeswap as otherfile when watermark is grater than
	  low_watermark. This helps to make use of zram swap.
