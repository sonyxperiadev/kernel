	bool "CPUQuiet Framework"
	help
	 Cpuquiet implements pluggable policies for forcing cpu cores into a
	 quiescent state. Appropriate policies will save power without hurting
	 performance.

config CPU_QUIET_STATS
	bool "per CPU statistics"
	depends on SYSFS
	default n
	help
	 Enable up/down count and total time plugged statistics per CPU. These
	 depend on correct driver input for reliability. The statistic value
	 can be checked under "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpux/cpuquiet/stats".

	 If in doubt say N.

config CPU_QUIET_GOVERNOR_USERSPACE

	help
	 Manual control of the number of CPUs online.
	 This governor allows userspace to control the number of online CPUs.
	 That means this governor allow user to implement the real governor
	 in user space.

	 If in doubt say Y.

	default y
	help
	 Scale the number of CPUs online depending on the number of runnable
	 threads.  This governor will scale the number of CPUs online depending
	 on the number of runnable threads.

	 If in doubt say Y.
