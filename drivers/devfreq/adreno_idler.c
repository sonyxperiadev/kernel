/*
 * Adreno idler - Idling algorithm,
 * an efficient workaround for msm-adreno-tz's overheads.
 *
 * Main goal is to lower the power consumptions while maintaining high-performance.
 *
 * Since msm-adreno-tz tends to *not* use the lowest frequency even on idle,
 * Adreno idler replaces msm-adreno-tz's algorithm when it comes to
 * calculating idle frequency(mostly by ondemand's method).
 * The higher frequencies are not touched with this algorithm, so high-demanding
 * games will (most likely) not suffer from worsened performance.
