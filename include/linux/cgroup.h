 *
 * Walk @cgroup's descendants.  Must be called under rcu_read_lock().  A
 * descendant cgroup which hasn't finished ->css_online() or already has
 * finished ->css_offline() may show up during traversal and it's each
 * subsystem's responsibility to verify that each @pos is alive.
 *
 * If a subsystem synchronizes against the parent in its ->css_online() and
 * before starting iterating, and synchronizes against @pos on each
 * iteration, any descendant cgroup which finished ->css_online() is
 * guaranteed to be visible in the future iterations.
 *
 * In other words, the following guarantees that a descendant can't escape
 * state updates of its ancestors.
 *
 * my_online(@cgrp)
 * {
 *	Lock @cgrp->parent and @cgrp;
 *	Inherit state from @cgrp->parent;
 *	Unlock both.
 * }
 *
 * my_update_state(@cgrp)
 * {
 *	Lock @cgrp;
 *	Update @cgrp's state;
 *	Unlock @cgrp;
 *
 *	cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre(@pos, @cgrp) {
 *		Lock @pos;
 *		Verify @pos is alive and inherit state from @pos->parent;
 *		Unlock @pos;
 *	}
 * }
 *
 * As long as the inheriting step, including checking the parent state, is
 * enclosed inside @pos locking, double-locking the parent isn't necessary
 * while inheriting.  The state update to the parent is guaranteed to be
 * visible by walking order and, as long as inheriting operations to the
 * same @pos are atomic to each other, multiple updates racing each other
 * still result in the correct state.  It's guaranateed that at least one
 * inheritance happens for any cgroup after the latest update to its
 * parent.
 *
 * If checking parent's state requires locking the parent, each inheriting
 * iteration should lock and unlock both @pos->parent and @pos.
 *
 * Alternatively, a subsystem may choose to use a single global lock to
 * synchronize ->css_online() and ->css_offline() against tree-walking
 * operations.
