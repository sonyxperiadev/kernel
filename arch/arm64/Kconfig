	default y
	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 826319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 4 ACE or
	  AXI master interface and an L2 cache.

	  If a Cortex-A53 uses an AMBA AXI4 ACE interface to other processors
	  and is unable to accept a certain write via this interface, it will
	  not progress on read data presented on the read data channel and the
	  system can deadlock.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to
	  data cache clean-and-invalidate.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 827319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 5 CHI
	  master interface and an L2 cache.

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction
	  to occur at the same time as another transaction to the same address
	  on the AMBA 5 CHI interface, which can cause data corruption if the
	  interconnect reorders the two transactions.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to
	  data cache clean-and-invalidate.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  erratum 824069 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 when it is connected

	  If a Cortex-A53 processor is executing a store or prefetch for
	  write instruction at the same time as a processor in another
	  cluster is executing a cache maintenance operation to the same
	  address, then this erratum might cause a clean cache line to be
	  incorrectly marked as dirty.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to
	  data cache clean-and-invalidate.
	  Please note that this option does not necessarily enable the
	  workaround, as it depends on the alternative framework, which will
	  only patch the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

config ARM64_ERRATUM_819472

	  If the processor is executing a load and store exclusive sequence at

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might deadlock when exclusive load/store
	  instructions to Write-Back memory are mixed with Device loads.

	  The workaround is to promote device loads to use Load-Acquire

	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 834220 on Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2.

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might report a Stage 2 translation
	  fault as the result of a Stage 1 fault for load crossing a
	  page boundary when there is a permission or device memory
	  alignment fault at Stage 1 and a translation fault at Stage 2.

	  The workaround is to verify that the Stage 1 translation
	  doesn't generate a fault before handling the Stage 2 fault.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  When running a compat (AArch32) userspace on an affected Cortex-A53
	  part, a load at EL0 from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32
	  bits of the virtual address used by a recent load at (AArch64) EL1
	  might return incorrect data.

	  The workaround is to write the contextidr_el1 register on exception
	  return to a 32-bit task.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  This option links the kernel with '--fix-cortex-a53-843419' and

	default y
	help
	  This option adds work around for Arm Cortex-A55 Erratum 1024718.

	  Affected Cortex-A55 cores (all revisions) could cause incorrect
	  update of the hardware dirty bit when the DBM/AP bits are updated
	  without a break-before-make. The work around is to disable the usage
	  of hardware DBM locally on the affected cores. CPUs not affected by
	  erratum will continue to use the feature.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This option adds workaround for ARM Cortex-A76 erratum 1286807

	  On the affected Cortex-A76 cores (r0p0 to r3p0), if a virtual
	  address for a cacheable mapping of a location is being
	  accessed by a core while another core is remapping the virtual
	  address to a new physical page using the recommended
	  break-before-make sequence, then under very rare circumstances
	  TLBI+DSB completes before a read using the translation being

	help
	  This option removes the AES hwcap for aarch32 user-space to
	  workaround erratum 1742098 on Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A72.

	  Affected parts may corrupt the AES state if an interrupt is
	  taken between a pair of AES instructions. These instructions

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAVIUM_ERRATUM_27456

	  On ThunderX T88 pass 1.x through 2.1 parts, broadcast TLBI

	help
	  This option enables support for a 32-bit EL0 running under a 64-bit
	  kernel at EL1. AArch32-specific components such as system calls,
	  the user helper functions, VFP support and the ptrace interface are
	  handled appropriately by the kernel.

	  If you use a page size other than 4KB (i.e, 16KB or 64KB), please be aware
	  that you will only be able to execute AArch32 binaries that were compiled
	  with page size aligned segments.

	  If you want to execute 32-bit userspace applications, say Y.

config KUSER_HELPERS
	bool "Enable the kuser helpers page in 32-bit processes"
	depends on COMPAT
	default y
	help
	  Warning: disabling this option may break 32-bit applications.

	  Provide kuser helpers in a special purpose fixed-address page. The
	  kernel provides helper code to userspace in read-only form at a fixed
	  location to allow userspace to be independent of the CPU type fitted
	  to the system. This permits 32-bit binaries to be run on ARMv6 through
	  to ARMv8 without modification.

	  See Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt for details.

	  However, the fixed-address nature of these helpers can be used by ROP
	  (return-orientated programming) authors when creating exploits.

	  If all of the 32-bit binaries and libraries that run on your platform
	  are built specifically for your platform, and make no use of these
	  helpers, then you can turn this option off to hinder such exploits.
	  However, in that case, if a binary or library relying on those helpers
	  is run, it will receive a SIGSEGV signal, which will terminate the
	  program. Typically, binaries compiled for ARMv7 or later do not use
	  the kuser helpers.

	  Say N here only if you are absolutely certain that you do not need
	  these helpers; otherwise, the safe option is to say Y (the default
	  for now)

	help
	  Warning: a 32-bit toolchain is necessary to build the vDSO. You
	  must explicitly define which toolchain should be used by setting
	  CROSS_COMPILE_ARM32 to the prefix of the 32-bit toolchain (same format
	  as CROSS_COMPILE). If CROSS_COMPILE_ARM32 is empty, a warning will be
	  printed and the kernel will be built as if COMPAT_VDSO had not been
	  set. If CROSS_COMPILE_ARM32 is set to an invalid prefix, compilation
	  will be aborted.

	  Provide a vDSO to 32-bit processes. It includes the symbols provided
	  by the vDSO from the 32-bit kernel, so that a 32-bit libc can use
	  the compat vDSO without modification. It also provides sigreturn
	  trampolines, replacing the sigreturn page.

config CROSS_COMPILE_ARM32
	string "32-bit toolchain prefix"
	help
	  Same as setting CROSS_COMPILE_ARM32 in the environment, but saved for
	  future builds. The environment variable overrides this config option.
