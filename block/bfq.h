 * A bfq_entity is used to represent either a bfq_queue (leaf node in the
 * cgroup hierarchy) or a bfq_group into the upper level scheduler.  Each
 * entity belongs to the sched_data of the parent group in the cgroup
 * hierarchy.  Non-leaf entities have also their own sched_data, stored
 * in @my_sched_data.
 *
 * Each entity stores independently its priority values; this would
 * allow different weights on different devices, but this
 * functionality is not exported to userspace by now.  Priorities and
 * weights are updated lazily, first storing the new values into the
 * new_* fields, then setting the @ioprio_changed flag.  As soon as
 * there is a transition in the entity state that allows the priority
 * update to take place the effective and the requested priority
 * values are synchronized.
 *
 * Unless cgroups are used, the weight value is calculated from the
 * ioprio to export the same interface as CFQ.  When dealing with
 * ``well-behaved'' queues (i.e., queues that do not spend too much
 * time to consume their budget and have true sequential behavior, and
 * when there are no external factors breaking anticipation) the
 * relative weights at each level of the cgroups hierarchy should be
 * guaranteed.  All the fields are protected by the queue lock of the
 * containing bfqd.

 *                         increments/decrements, would imply more overhead
 *                         than just updating busy_in_flight_queues

 * @bfq_timeout: timeout for bfq_queues to consume their budget; used to
 *               to prevent seeky queues to impose long latencies to well
