	help
	  Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in virtual memory.

	  Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be
	  created on your hard drive. The files live in memory and swap
	  space. If you unmount a tmpfs instance, everything stored therein is
	  lost.

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt> for details.

config TMPFS_POSIX_ACL

	select GENERIC_ACL
	help
	  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support additional access rights
	  for users and groups beyond the standard owner/group/world scheme,
	  and this option selects support for ACLs specifically for tmpfs
	  filesystems.

	  If you've selected TMPFS, it's possible that you'll also need
	  this option as there are a number of Linux distros that require
	  POSIX ACL support under /dev for certain features to work properly.
	  For example, some distros need this feature for ALSA-related /dev
	  files for sound to work properly.  In short, if you're not sure,
	  say Y.

	  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the POSIX ACLs for
	  Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.

config TMPFS_XATTR
	bool "Tmpfs extended attributes"
	depends on TMPFS

	help
	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit
	  <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  Currently this enables support for the trusted.* and
	  security.* namespaces.

	  You need this for POSIX ACL support on tmpfs.

	  If unsure, say N.
