config PSTORE
	bool "Persistent store support"
	default n
	help
	   This option enables generic access to platform level
	   persistent storage via "pstore" filesystem that can
	   be mounted as /dev/pstore.  Only useful if you have
	   a platform level driver that registers with pstore to
	   provide the data, so you probably should just go say "Y"
	   (or "M") to a platform specific persistent store driver
	   (e.g. ACPI_APEI on X86) which will select this for you.
	   If you don't have a platform persistent store driver,
	   say N.

config PSTORE_CONSOLE
	bool "Log kernel console messages"
	depends on PSTORE
	help
	  When the option is enabled, pstore will log all kernel
	  messages, even if no oops or panic happened.

config PSTORE_FTRACE
	bool "Persistent function tracer"
	depends on PSTORE
	depends on FUNCTION_TRACER
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  With this option kernel traces function calls into a persistent
	  ram buffer that can be decoded and dumped after reboot through
	  pstore filesystem. It can be used to determine what function
	  was last called before a reset or panic.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PSTORE_RAM
	tristate "Log panic/oops to a RAM buffer"
	depends on PSTORE
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK
	select REED_SOLOMON
	select REED_SOLOMON_ENC8
	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC8
	help
	  This enables panic and oops messages to be logged to a circular
	  buffer in RAM where it can be read back at some later point.

	  Note that for historical reasons, the module will be named
	  "ramoops.ko".

	  For more information, see Documentation/ramoops.txt.

config PSTORE_RAM_ANNOTATION_APPEND
	bool "Allow appending messages to pstore ram annotation"
	default n
	depends on PSTORE_RAM
	help
	  Existing pstore ram annotation stores messages and exports them
	  after reset. Sometimes only after reset can we do some postmortem
	  analysis. This adds function which can be used to append the
	  analysis info to pstore ram annotation. The function should only
	  be used before pstore ram annotation is exported. It's safe to use
	  the function before pstore is initialized. Content will be buffered
	  and merged to annotation-ramoops file.
	  If unsure, say N.
