Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. TSENS driver

Temperature sensor (TSENS) driver supports reading temperature from sensors
across the MSM. The driver defaults to support a 12 bit ADC.

The driver uses the Thermal sysfs framework to provide thermal
clients the ability to read from supported on-die temperature sensors,
set temperature thresholds for cool/warm thresholds and receive notification
on temperature threshold events.

TSENS node

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,msm8996-tsens" for 8996 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,msm8953-tsens" for 8953 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,msm8998-tsens" for 8998 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,msmhamster-tsens" for hamster TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,sdm660-tsens" for 660 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,sdm630-tsens" for 630 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,sdm845-tsens" for SDM845 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,tsens24xx" for 2.4 TSENS controller.
	       should be "qcom,msm8937-tsens" for 8937 TSENS driver.
	       should be "qcom,msm8909-tsens" for 8909 TSENS driver.
	       The compatible property is used to identify the respective controller to use
	       for the corresponding SoC.
- reg : offset and length of the TSENS registers with associated property in reg-names
	as "tsens_srot_physical" for TSENS SROT physical address region. TSENS TM
	physical address region as "tsens_tm_physical".
- reg-names : resource names used for the physical address of the TSENS
	      registers. Should be "tsens_srot_physical" for physical address of the TSENS
	      SROT region and "tsens_tm_physical" for physical address of the TM region.
- interrupts : TSENS interrupt to notify Upper/Lower and Critical temperature threshold.
- interrupt-names: Should be "tsens-upper-lower" for temperature threshold.
		   Add "tsens-critical" for Critical temperature threshold notification
		   in addition to "tsens-upper-lower" for 8996 TSENS since
		   8996 supports Upper/Lower and Critical temperature threshold.

Example:

tsens@fc4a8000 {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-tsens";
	reg = <0xfc4a8000 0x10>,
		<0xfc4b8000 0x1ff>;
	reg-names = "tsens_srot_physical",
		    "tsens_tm_physical";
	interrupts = <0 184 0>;
	interrupt-names = "tsens-upper-lower";
};
