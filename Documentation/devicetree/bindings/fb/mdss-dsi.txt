Qualcomm mdss-dsi

mdss-dsi is the master DSI device which supports multiple DSI host controllers that
are compatible with MIPI display serial interface specification.

Required properties:
- compatible:				Must be "qcom,mdss-dsi"
- hw-config:				Specifies the DSI host setup configuration
					"hw-config" = "single_dsi"
					"hw-config" = "dual_dsi"
					"hw-config" = "split_dsi"
- ranges:				The standard property which specifies the child address
					space, parent address space and the length.
- vdda-supply:				Phandle for vreg regulator device node.

Optional properties:
- vcca-supply:				Phandle for vcca regulator device node.
- pll-src-config			Specified the source PLL for the DSI
					link clocks:
					"PLL0" - Clocks sourced out of DSI PLL0
					"PLL1" - Clocks sourced out of DSI PLL1
					This property is only valid for
					certain DSI hardware configurations
					mentioned in the "hw-config" binding above.
					For split_dsi config, the clocks can
					only be sourced out of PLL0. For
					dual_dsi, both PLL would be active.
					For single DSI, it is possible to
					select either PLL. If no value is specified,
					the default value for single DSI is set as PLL0.
- qcom,ctrl-supply-entries:		A node that lists the elements of the supply used by the
					DSI controller. There can be more than one instance
					of this binding, in which case the entry would be appended
					with the supply entry index.
					e.g. qcom,ctrl-supply-entry@0
					-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
					-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
					-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
					-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
					-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off
- qcom,phy-supply-entries:		A node that lists the elements of the supply used by the
					DSI PHY. There can be more than one instance
					of this binding, in which case the entry would be appended
					with the supply entry index.
					e.g. qcom,ctrl-supply-entry@0
					-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
					-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
					-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
					-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
					-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off
- qcom,core-supply-entries:		A node that lists the elements of the supply used to
					power the DSI core. There can be more than one instance
					of this binding, in which case the entry would be appended
					with the supply entry index. For a detailed description of
					fields in the supply entry, refer to the qcom,ctrl-supply-entries
					binding above.
- qcom,mmss-ulp-clamp-ctrl-offset:	Specifies the offset for dsi ulps clamp control register.
- qcom,mmss-phyreset-ctrl-offset:	Specifies the offset for dsi phy reset control register.
- qcom,timing-db-mode:			Boolean specifies dsi timing mode registers are supported or not.
- qcom,dsi-clk-ln-recovery:		Boolean which enables the clk lane recovery
- qcom,split-dsi-independent-pll:	Boolean which specifies if the individual DSI controllers need to be
					driven by respective DSI PLLs for split DSI use-cases which is required
					on specific MSM revisions. This property supersedes the default configuration
					of using a shared PLL for split DSI configuration and is not applicable to
					single/dual DSI configurations.

mdss-dsi-ctrl is a dsi controller device which is treated as a subnode of the mdss-dsi device.

Required properties:
