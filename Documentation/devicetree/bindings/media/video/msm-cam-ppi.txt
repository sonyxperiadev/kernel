* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM camera PPI

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================
The camera PPI node must be described in First level of device nodes. The
first level describe the overall PPI node structure.

  Value type: <string>
  Definition: List of clock names required for PPI HW.

- clock-rates
  Usage: required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: List of clock rates in Hz for PPI HW.

- clock-cntl-level
  Usage: required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: All different clock level node can support.

- clocks
  Usage: required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: all clock phandle and source clocks.

- regulator-names
  Usage: required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: name of the voltage regulators required for the device.

- gdscr-supply
  Usage: required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: should contain gdsr regulator used for PPI clocks.

Example:
     qcom,ppi0@ace0000 {
     cell-index = <0>;
     compatible = "qcom,ppi170";
     reg-names = "ppi";
     reg = <0xace0000 0x200>;
     reg-cam-base = <0xe0000>;
     interrupt-names = "ppi";
     interrupts = <0 202 0>;
     regulator-names = "gdscr", "refgen";
     gdscr-supply = <&titan_top_gdsc>;
     clocks = <&clock_camcc CAM_CC_CPHY_RX_CLK_SRC>,
              <&clock_camcc CAM_CC_PPI0_CLK>,
              <&clock_camcc CAM_CC_CSI0PHYTIMER_CLK_SRC>,
              <&clock_camcc CAM_CC_CSI0PHYTIMER_CLK>;
     clock-names = "cphy_rx_clk_src", "ppi0_clk"
     clock-rates = <400000000 0 300000000 0>;
     clock-cntl-level = "turbo";
     status = "ok";
};
