synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER. Complies to the generic USB binding properties
      as described in 'usb/generic.txt'

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "snps,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.

Optional properties:
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device.  The first element
   in the array is expected to be a handle to the USB2/HS PHY and
   the second element is expected to be a handle to the USB3/SS PHY
 - phys: from the *Generic PHY* bindings
 - phy-names: from the *Generic PHY* bindings; supported names are "usb2-phy"
	or "usb3-phy".
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.
 - snps,usb3_lpm_capable: determines if platform is USB3 LPM capable
 - snps,disable_scramble_quirk: true when SW should disable data scrambling.
	Only really useful for FPGA builds.
 - snps,has-lpm-erratum: true when DWC3 was configured with LPM Erratum enabled
 - snps,lpm-nyet-threshold: LPM NYET threshold
 - snps,u2exit_lfps_quirk: set if we want to enable u2exit lfps quirk
 - snps,u2ss_inp3_quirk: set if we enable P3 OK for U2/SS Inactive quirk
 - snps,req_p1p2p3_quirk: when set, the core will always request for
			P1/P2/P3 transition sequence.
 - snps,del_p1p2p3_quirk: when set core will delay P1/P2/P3 until a certain
			amount of 8B10B errors occur.
 - snps,del_phy_power_chg_quirk: when set core will delay PHY power change
			from P0 to P1/P2/P3.
 - snps,lfps_filter_quirk: when set core will filter LFPS reception.
 - snps,rx_detect_poll_quirk: when set core will disable a 400us delay to start
			Polling LFPS after RX.Detect.
 - snps,tx_de_emphasis_quirk: when set core will set Tx de-emphasis value.
 - snps,tx_de_emphasis: the value driven to the PHY is controlled by the
			LTSSM during USB3 Compliance mode.
 - snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk: when set core will disable USB3 suspend phy.
 - snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk: when set core will disable USB2 suspend phy.
 - snps,dis_enblslpm_quirk: when set clears the enblslpm in GUSB2PHYCFG,
			disabling the suspend signal to the PHY.
 - snps,dis_rxdet_inp3_quirk: when set core will disable receiver detection
			in PHY P3 power state.
 - snps,dis-u2-freeclk-exists-quirk: when set, clear the u2_freeclk_exists
			in GUSB2PHYCFG, specify that USB2 PHY doesn't provide
			a free-running PHY clock.
 - snps,dis-del-phy-power-chg-quirk: when set core will change PHY power
			from P0 to P1/P2/P3 without delay.
 - snps,dis-tx-ipgap-linecheck-quirk: when set, disable u2mac linestate check
			during HS transmit.
 - snps,parkmode-disable-ss-quirk: when set, all SuperSpeed bus instances in
			park mode are disabled.
 - snps,dis_metastability_quirk: when set, disable metastability workaround.
			CAUTION: use only if you are absolutely sure of it.
 - snps,ssp-u3-u0-quirk: when set, core always changes PHY power state
                        to P2, before attempting a U3 exit handshake.
 - snps,is-utmi-l1-suspend: true when DWC3 asserts output signal
			utmi_l1_suspend_n, false when asserts utmi_sleep_n
 - snps,hird-threshold: HIRD threshold
 - snps,hsphy_interface: High-Speed PHY interface selection between "utmi" for
   UTMI+ and "ulpi" for ULPI when the DWC_USB3_HSPHY_INTERFACE has value 3.
 - snps,quirk-frame-length-adjustment: Value for GFLADJ_30MHZ field of GFLADJ
	register for post-silicon frame length adjustment when the
	fladj_30mhz_sdbnd signal is invalid or incorrect.
 - snps,xhci-imod-value: Interrupt moderation interval for host mode
	(in increments of 250nsec).
 - usb-core-id: Differentiates between different controllers present on a device.
 - snps,bus-suspend-enable: If present then controller supports low power mode
	during bus suspend.
 - snps,usb3-u1u2-disable: If present, disable U1U2 low power modes in Superspeed mode
 - snps,disable-clk-gating: If present, disable controller's internal clock gating.
   Default it is enabled.

 - in addition all properties from usb-xhci.txt from the current directory are
   supported as well
