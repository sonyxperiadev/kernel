* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. ConNectivity SubSystem Platform Driver

This platform driver adds support for the CNSS subsystem used for PCIe
based Wi-Fi devices. It also adds support to integrate PCIe WLAN module
to subsystem restart framework. Apart from that, it also manages the
3.3V voltage regulator, WLAN Enable GPIO signal and PCIe link dynamically
with support for suspend and resume by retaining the PCI config space
states when PCIe link is shutdown. The main purpose of this device tree
entry below is to invoke the CNSS platform driver and provide handle to
the WLAN enable GPIO, 3.3V fixed voltage regulator resources. It also
provides the reserved RAM dump memory location and size.

                                 format to be used for allocations associated
                                 between WLAN/PCIe and SMMU
  - qcom,wlan-ramdump-dynamic: To enable CNSS RAMDUMP collection
                               by providing the size of CNSS DUMP
  - reg: Memory regions defined as starting address and size
  - reg-names: Names of the memory regions defined in reg entry
  - wlan-bootstrap-gpio: WLAN_BOOTSTRAP GPIO signal specified by QCA6174
                         which should be drived depending on platforms
  - qcom,is-dual-wifi-enabled: Boolean property to control wlan enable(wlan-en)
                               gpio on dual-wifi platforms.
  - vdd-wlan-en-supply: WLAN_EN fixed regulator specified by QCA6174
                        specifications.
  - qcom,wlan-en-vreg-support: Boolean property to decide the whether the
                               WLAN_EN pin is a gpio or fixed regulator.
  - qcom,mhi: phandle to indicate the device which needs MHI support.
  - qcom,cap-tsf-gpio: WLAN_TSF_CAPTURED GPIO signal specified by the chip
                       specifications, should be drived depending on products
